Fedora Base Notes
=================

Fedora-Docker-Base-extracted-20141203-21.x86_64.tar.gz was originally extracted
from an official Fedora Docker 'image' which is located at the following URL:

Original File
-------------
https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/21/Docker/x86_64/Fedora-Docker-Base-20141203-21.x86_64.tar.gz

Signed Checksum
---------------
https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/21/Docker/x86_64/Fedora-Docker-x86_64-21-CHECKSUM

The original file's signed checksum was verifed against release signing key and
then the sha245sum was alse verified

Then the original file was extracted.  It created the following director 
structure:

7415718e91b4813d4d4f612a2f037995c1bbebe9644fc0f99d3e8841735f12bd/
├── json
├── layer.tar
└── VERSION
0 directories, 3 files

layer.tar was then renamed to Fedora-Docker-Base-extracted-20141203-21.x86_64.tar
and then gziped to: Fedora-Docker-Base-extracted-20141203-21.x86_64.tar.gz
then placed here.

Two other small modifcations  were made in prepare-chroot-fedora and in the
template directory 01_install_core.sh.  Otherwise all the other additions
to get Fedora 21 to compile are same as other past configurations.

Here are the modifications:

prepare-chroot-fedora
---------------------
if [ -f base_rpms_$DISTRO/*.tar.gz ]; then
    tar xvfz base_rpms_$DISTRO/*.tar.gz -C $DIR
else
    rpm -i --root=$DIR base_rpms_$DISTRO/*.rpm
fi

01_install_core.sh
------------------
if [ -f $SCRIPTSDIR/base_rpms_$DISTRO/*.tar.gz ]; then
    tar xvfz $SCRIPTSDIR/base_rpms/*.tar.gz -C $INSTALLDIR
else
    rpm -i --root=$INSTALLDIR $SCRIPTSDIR/base_rpms/*.rpm || exit 1
fi
